# Website Design Overview

This website showcases two pricing cards using a modern and responsive design. The design approach emphasizes clarity, usability, and visual appeal.

## Layout
- **Bootstrap Framework**: Utilizes the Bootstrap framework for a responsive and flexible layout.
- **Two-Column Grid**: The pricing cards are placed in a two-column grid layout, ensuring a balanced and organized presentation.

## Typography
- **Fonts**: The website uses Google Fonts, specifically 'Poppins' for a clean and contemporary look.
- **Text Styling**: Various font weights and sizes are used to create a clear hierarchy, making the information easy to read.

## Card Design
- **Rounded Corners**: Both cards feature rounded corners (`rounded-4`), giving them a modern and friendly appearance.
- **Shadow Effect**: A subtle shadow (`shadow-lg`) is applied to the cards, adding depth and a sense of elevation.
- **Consistent Spacing**: Adequate margins and padding ensure the content is well-spaced and visually appealing.

## Color Scheme
- **Free Plan**: The card uses a light theme with a white background and dark text, creating a clean and minimalistic look.
- **Premium Plan**: The card uses a dark theme with a dark background and white text, providing a strong contrast and highlighting the premium nature of the plan.

## Icons and Buttons
- **Icons**: Bootstrap Icons (`bi`) are used to visually represent the features of each plan.
- **Buttons**: Each card includes a prominently styled button (`btn`), encouraging user interaction. The button colors are chosen to complement the card themes (dark for the free plan, light for the premium plan).

## Responsiveness
- **Media Queries**: The design adjusts for different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices.
- **Mobile-Friendly**: The use of Bootstrap's responsive grid system ensures the content adapts well to mobile screens, maintaining usability and readability.

This design approach ensures that the pricing cards are not only visually appealing but also user-friendly and accessible on all devices.
